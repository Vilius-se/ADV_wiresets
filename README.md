# This Damn Tool

## What the hell is this?

It’s the shit I slapped together because nobody else gave a damn about the mind-numbing bullshit nobody wants to do. If you're reading this, congrats—you inherit the garbage.

## How to use it?

Run it. Try not to break it. If you screw it up, deal with it.

## Why did I bother?

Because I’m sick of doing everyone else’s dumb repetitive crap while management jerks off in meetings.

## Why am I leaving?

Because this circus of clowns and their bullshit finally blew my last nerve.

## Final words

Good luck fixing this mess after I’m gone. You’ll need it. Fuck off.
